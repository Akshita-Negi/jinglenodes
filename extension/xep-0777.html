       <a name="intro" id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
		<p>
Jingle Nodes are an XMPP Based UDP Relay Services providing standard UDP Relay, but negotiated via XMPP.
Jingle Relay Nodes are intend to provide easy to use Jingle Relay Type Candidates that can be used in ICE-UDP and RAW-UDP Jingle Sessions.
Relay Candidates can provide NAT Traversal for Jingle users with or without STUN/TURN Support.
The main benefits of Jingle Relay Nodes is the easy to use candidates, Jingle Clients can became a Node and Jingle Relay Nodes are published via XMPP, meaning every Client or Server can also act as a tracker of another Nodes.</p>
	<h2>2.
       <a name="reqs" id="reqs">Requirements</a></h2>
		<p>Jingle Relay Nodes MUST be binded directly to a Public IP address without firewall for UDP traffic on the port range reserved to be used by relay candidates. This is the main and unique requirement for a peer provide Relay Nodes Service.
All signalling, request, response and publishing is done via XMPP, not requiring any extra stack or protocol in the Client or Server, for usage and discoveral of Nodes.</p>

			<p>In diagrams, the following conventions are used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Single-dashed lines (---) represent Jingle stanzas that are sent via the XMPP signalling channel.</li>
				<li>Double-dashed lines (===) represent media packets that are sent via the data channel, which typically is not an XMPP channel (although the <span class="ref">Jingle In-Band Bytestreams Transport Method</span> is an exception) but instead is a direct or mediated channel between the endpoints.</li>
			</ul>

       <a name="usecases" id="usecases">Use Cases</a></h2>
		<div class="indent"><h3>4.1 <a name="rawudpnostun" id="rawudpnostun">Jingle Client with RAW-UDP Transport without any NAT detection mechanism</a></h3>
			<p>A Jingle Client with only RAW-UDP support and any NAT detection mechanism can make use of Jingle Nodes. Although the traversal is not guarantee due problem with NAT configuration or firewalls, this method is fairly efficient as most SIP legacy services still provides their services in a similar way, meaning that this has the exactly same accertivity and reliability than regular SIP Services. This method is extremelly useful specially for simple platforms like mobile and clients in early stage of development that still wants to offer voice and video support.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="em">Note: This use case is also similar to a Jingle to SIP Interoperability Service.</span>
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="indent"><h3>4.2 <a name="iceudpnoturn" id="iceudpnoturn">Jingle Client with ICE-UDP Transport with STUN support but no TURN support</a></h3>
			<p>A Jingle Client with STUN support but no TURN support can use Relay Node Services as the fallback candidate instead of a TURN candidate. For instance, after a connectivity check proccess, none of the direct candidates worked. The Client can use the Relay Node Candidate as the fallback candidate(the lowest priority candidate).</p>
		</div>
		<div class="indent"><h3>4.3 <a name="iceudpstunturn" id="iceudpstunturn">Jingle Client with ICE-UDP Transport with STUN and TURN support</a></h3>
			<p>A Jingle Client with STUN and TURN support still might need a Relay Candidate, specially as TURN servers are not widely deployed and don't have any mechanism to publish available services for users. TURN servers also requires specific UDP traffic in specific port ranges which can be blocked by users networks. In this case is very useful to have an extra fallback candidate that can be negotiated via XMPP rather than over UDP.</p>
			<p>
				<span class="em">Note: Jingle Relay Nodes Services are much more likely to be found and be available than TURN servers, as users can also provide Jingle Relay Nodes services themselves or provide a list of known and available services, in this last case behaving a tracker. Is very likely that Jingle Relay Nodes will be available and discovered more easily and often than TURN servers.</span>

			<p>A XMPP Client or Component with direct access to a public IP can potentially provide the UDP Relay Service becaming itself a Jingle Relay Node. The service can intend to provide a public service, or a restricted services based on user preferences, like buddylist, whitelist, blacklist, domain, etc...</p>

		<p>It is heavily recommended that the Super Node implements throttle:</p>
		<ul>
			<p>
				<li>Based on JID, allowing the control of how many concurrent channels an specific JID can have.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Based on JID, allowing the control of how many channel requests an specific JID can request in a time period.</li>
			</p>
			<p>
				<li>Based on Bandwidth, allowing the control of how much bandwidth a channel can use. The maximum bandwidth SHOULD be included on the candidate element provided by a Super Node on the attribute maxkbps. If no attribute is present, it means that it has no bandwidth control.</li>
