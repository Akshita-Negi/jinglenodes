#summary Functional Specification for Services API
#labels FunctionalSpecification,ServicesAPI

== Scope of the API ==

The services API aims to provide the relay functionality, it has the goal of providing a generic RTP Relay Library.
That can be use in an application to provide:

 # Dynamic RTP/UDP Relay Channels
 # Basic Permissions Rules based on domain whitelist
 # Basic Permissions Rules based on Max Concurrent Channels per User(BareJID);

== Auto of Scope ==

As a Prototype Services API does NOT intend to provide:
  # Provide XMPP Connectivity, as it is meant to be generic as reusable for different XMPP Clients and Servers.
  # Blacklist Permission Rules
  # RTP/TCP Transport Relay

== User Interaction ==

Application can use the Library for the following tasks:
  # Request a Dynamic Bind Relay Channel - Dynamic as the Channel has a mechanism that does not require User/Application Interaction in order to bind the Channel both ways.
  # Request Destruction of a Channel
  # Select the Domain Whitelist that can request Channels
  # Select the Max Concurrent Channels per User(BareJID)

== Services Activities ==

The Services API has Internal Activities and Responsibilities:
  # Timeout, Expire and Destroy Inactive Channels (Inactivity is based on last packet received by the Channel)
